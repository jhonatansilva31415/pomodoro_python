# Simple Pomodoro project with python

You can read the post that explains the code [here](https://jhonatandasilva.com/published/1627031260)

## Requirements 

- Python3 
- Redis

But the idea is a CLI tool to use pomodoro. 

You have the option to set your default time and break times with

```bash 
python pomodoro.py init
```

And you can start the pomodoro with 

```bash 
python pomodoro.py start
```
